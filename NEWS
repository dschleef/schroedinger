1.0.6
=====

 - Requires liboil-0.3.16
 - New configure flag '--disable-encoder' useful for embedded
   systems that don't require the encoder.
 - New constant-quality encoding mode, enabled by setting the encoder
   setting 'rate-control' to 6, and adjusting 'quality' from 0 to 10.
   (Interesting range is 3-7).
 - Various encoder improvements
 - Speed improvements in decoder
 - API additions for parsing streams in the decoder
 - API improvements handling interlaced video
 - Rewrite of the GStreamer elements, including new base classes
   for video encoding and decoding
 - Moved extra GStreamer elements to Cog
 - Experimental code that uses Orc instead of liboil (--enable-orc)

1.0.5-1.0.2
===========

 - ...

1.0.1
=====

 - Add API reference documentation for SchroDecoder.
 - Restructure API reference documentation, although coverage is very
   low.
 - Default GOP structure now uses 3 reference frames.  This gives a
   very slight improvement in quality.
 - Fix encode/decode mismatch for low-delay syntax.
 - Fix brokenness in CBR intra-only encoding
 - Additional testing and code cleanups
 - Eliminate artificial width limitation in encoder and decoder.
 - Fix encoding/decoding of video offset and excursion.
 - Fix granulepos calculation in GStreamer encoder element
 - Set DELTA_UNIT correctly in GStreamer encoder element
 - Update code path used when pthread is disabled.

1.0.0
=====

 - Major release

0.2.1
=====

 - Encoder and decoder nearly complete.  The bitstream is nearly
   compatible with Dirac, except in a few cases for predicted frames.
   Note that the Dirac bitstream isn't frozen, so that's kind of
   irrelevant.
 - Requires liboil-0.3.10.
